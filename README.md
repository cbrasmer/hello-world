# hello-world
This is my first github repository.
My name is Craig Brasmer, and I am learning how to be a programmer
  I believe that it is never too late to learn something new. I spent years thinking it would take too long to start something new.
  The older you get, however, the faster one precieves time. This really helps out when learning something new. At 50 years old, 
  a few years is just a drop in the bucket.
